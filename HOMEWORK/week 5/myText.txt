The evening breeze carried the scent of rain as distant lights flickered across the quiet valley. A small cat wandered near the riverbank, chasing shadows that danced between stones. Somewhere, a clock tower echoed a slow rhythm, marking the passing of hours that felt both endless and fleeting. Every sound, from the rustle of leaves to the whisper of water, seemed to weave a gentle story of calm persistence. The world, wrapped in silver mist, appeared to hold its breath â€” waiting, listening, existing in a moment too delicate to last, yet too beautiful to forget.
