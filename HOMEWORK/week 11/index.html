        controlling the blinklights with the buttons and Potentiometers
    </header>

        <p>during this assignment, I really enjoyed the part of buildiing the hardwares to make a real thing- a real function. but the part of coding, it is still a difficulte part for me. I also need to get some helps from the chatGPT, but in this time, at least, I try to understand the output of each step.
            about the blinklights project, i use the Potentiometers to control the blink rate of the light, when the potvalue lower than 1366, it will use the blink model one.if potValue < 2731,it will trigger the mode two. if it is neither, it will trigger the third mode. also, i have two lights, so the button will control which light will be activated.
